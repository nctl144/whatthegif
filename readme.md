# WHAT THE GIF?!

The program will select one player to be the judge,
the judge will draw a random prompt from an array and
remove that random prompt from the array. Players will then
react by entering a noun/verb that will use the gifhy(?) to pull a random reaction to the console. The judge will vote on the best reaction, which will increase the player selected's score. Once the
user gets to three points, they win.
